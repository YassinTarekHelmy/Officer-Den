- **Unity Timeline:** I Laid hand on the Unity Timeline to make some cutscenes.
- **Office:** Building the Office was a good experience in level design.
- **More Complex Multi-Scene Structure:** Using Bootsrapper Scenes in order to have more control on which object is initialized before which is a perfect way of handling data and sending data between sceenes is a perfect learning topic.
